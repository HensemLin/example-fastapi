            "sub_info": "Axie Infinity is a universe filled with fierce, collectible creatures called Axies. Axie features a player-owned economy where players have complete ownership of their digital assets and can buy, sell, and trade them just like physical trading cards and collectibles. The Axie universe is always expanding through new games and experiences. Many of these experiences will allow players to compete with each other using complex strategies and tactics to attain top rankings or be rewarded with coveted resources. Others will have them complete quests, defeat bosses, and unlock in-depth storylines. The number of Axie combination is almost infinite. Each Axie has a variety of parts based on a unique genetic code. These genes correspond to body parts which can be interpreted in different ways by different experiences. For example, the first generation of Axie games have all featured systems where Axies can play cards or use moves in battle determined by their body parts.",

            "sub_info": "All art assets and Axie genetic data can be easily accessed by 3rd parties, allowing community developers to build their own tools and experiences in the Axie Infinity universe. While still in early access, Axie is ranked the #1 Ethereum game by daily, weekly, and monthly active users. Players have spent over 1M ETH (4B+ USD) so far in the Axie universe. While Axie is a fun game, it's also taken on characteristics of a social network and earning platform due to the strong community and opportunity to truly own resources earned within the games. A key difference between Axie and a traditional game is that Blockchain economic design unlocks the ability to have complex player-owned economies and reward players who are able to reach advanced levels of skill. Players are able to have fun and work towards ambitious goals while simultaneously earning potential resources that will have real monetary value due to an open economic system and demand from other players - “Play-and-Earn”. Currently, players can gain more resources to advance in the game by: Competing in Battles to win leaderboard prizes as well as Smooth Love Potions (SLP) Breeding Axies to produce new ones with particular Body Part combinations Collecting and speculating on rare Axies such as Mystics and Origins Creating art and content On-boarding newcomers to the Axie universe Competing in Battles to win leaderboard prizes as well as Smooth Love Potions (SLP) Breeding Axies to produce new ones with particular Body Part combinations Collecting and speculating on rare Axies such as Mystics and Origins Creating art and content On-boarding newcomers to the Axie universe",

By doing this we will deliver property rights to all users of the internet, starting with gamers. Axie is a digital nation where people globally come together to play, work, and make lifelong connections. When we started this journey 4 years we weren't sure where we'd end up but we believed that if we asked the right questions we could build something with you that had never been seen before. We asked: What if we built a game that could onboard the world to Web3? What if we could make crypto nostalgic,educational, and immersive? What if a game could be built by developers and players working together through aligned incentives? What if we built a game that could onboard the world to Web3? What if we could make crypto nostalgic,educational, and immersive? What if a game could be built by developers and players working together through aligned incentives? Welcome to the Axie revolution. Disclaimer: Please note that anything written in this white paper should not be taken as financial advice. Axie is a bleeding-edge game that's incorporating unfinished, risky, and highly experimental technology. Development priorities, roadmaps, and features are subject to radical overhaul based on research, traction, feedback from the community, and a myriad of other factors.",
