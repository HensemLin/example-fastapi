    "info": "Like real-world pets, Axies can be bred to create new offspring. To avoid hyperinflation of Axies there is a maximum amount of times an Axie can be bred before it is sterile. Breeding an Axie costs AXS and some Smooth Love Potions depending on how many times the Axies have been bred. The AXS portion is variable and subject to adjustment based on a myriad of economic factors. Axies cannot be bred with their children and Axies cannot breed with their siblings. Axie Infinity does not sell $SLP to players directly. Smooth Love potions can be earned by playing the game in the PvP Arena. Once you earn them, you can sync them to your wallet from this page. ​",

            "sub_info": "Each Axie has 6 body parts as well as a body shape. For each part, an Axie possesses 3 genes. A dominant (D), recessive (R1), and minor recessive gene (R2). The dominant gene is what determines the body part that is physically present on the Axie. When breeding, each gene has a chance to be passed down to offspring: Dominant (D): 37.5% chance to pass this gene to offspring. Recessive (R1): 9.375% chance to pass this gene to offspring. Minor Recessive (R2): 3.125% chance to pass this gene to offspring. You can use this calculator to look up the probabilities when breeding 2 Axies. While we don’t show recessive genes on our website yet, you can view them using this extension built by one of our community members, Freak. In order to breed, simply go to the page for one of your Axies by clicking on it through your inventory . Next, click “Breed”. Then select an Axie to pair it with! How Long Does it take for an Axie to become an adult? Axies take 5 days to reach maturity. After 5 days, you can morph your egg to an adult Axie and see the Axie's genes. ​",
