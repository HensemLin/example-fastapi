As time passed it became clear that building a blockchain game solely on Ethereum would not be feasible from a scalability standpoint. We have learned that while our users care about blockchain technology they are focused on the benefits it can bring, rather than decentralizing too many features. As long as we provide a tamper-evident distributed ledger that ensures scarcity and allows our players to own and trade their assets it will be enough, for now. The mechanics of Play to Earn do not require a fully decentralized public blockchain. We believe that part of the ethos of web 3 is the idea of users being rewarded for the value that they bring to applications and this is what we choose to focus on with Axie.",
