    "info": "Staking Staking is a way for us to reward our community members for having a long term mindset and locking up their AXS tokens. By staking your AXS you’ll be able to earn AXS rewards when you lock up your tokens through the staking dashboard. In the future, staking AXS will give you voting rights and a say over the use of the Community Treasury which now holds over a billion dollars in tokens . ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Incentivizing stakers to add value to Axie Infinity - The Axie Score. In the future, we may upgrade our staking system to give better rewards to those that have measurably added value to the Axie ecosystem prior to claiming. There is still much research and experimentation to be done in this aspect of governance. The stakers who are not players or interested in participating in governance could be able to delegate their required \"work\" to other parties. This might lead to a future where guilds or corporations with massive amounts of AXS will need to look for talented players who can ensure a high enough Axie score to collect weekly yield. ​ ",
