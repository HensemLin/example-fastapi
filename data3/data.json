        "info": "Axie Infinity Shards(AXS) are an ERC-20 governance token for the Axie Universe. AXS holders will be able to claim rewards if they stake their tokens, play the game, and participate in key governance votes. Players will also be able to earn $AXS when they play various games within the Axie Infinity Universe and through user-generated content initiatives. Our goal with Axie Infinity Shards is to align the incentives between the players of the game and the developers in novel and exciting ways. The mechanisms described above have two main goals: To reward players for interacting with Axie Infinity while simultaneously incentivizing them to hold on to their tokens so they can claim additional rewards. To decentralize the ownership and governance of Axie Infinity. To reward players for interacting with Axie Infinity while simultaneously incentivizing them to hold on to their tokens so they can claim additional rewards. To decentralize the ownership and governance of Axie Infinity. We want Axie to become the first game truly owned and operated by the community that plays it. This opens up limitless possibilities but must be approached carefully. In the past, projects have been abandoned and become stagnant using the term “decentralization” as a ruse. The shift to a true Decentralized organization will occur gradually over time. In early 2021, the Community Treasury will go live. The Community Treasury will begin to receive revenues generated by Axie Infinity as well as a portion of staking rewards. This treasury will be governed by AXS stakers eventually, once the network has become sufficiently decentralized. The Treasury receives inflows from: 4.25% of all Axie NFT marketplace transactions. The AXS portion of the breeding fee. 4.25% of all Axie NFT marketplace transactions. The AXS portion of the breeding fee. More streams will be added in the future from cosmetic sales, tournament entree fees, licensing fees, and more as new opportunities present themselves. In the early days of Axie Infinity, staking issuance will be high-- encouraging a high portion of staked AXS without requiring an additional source of funding. However, as the issuance allocation drops over time, there will need to be another source of funding to encourage a high percentage of staked AXS. This is a potential use for the Community Treasury, which will have a sustainable source of funding from fees related to Axie infinity.

The AXS portion is variable and subject to adjustment based on a myriad of economic factors. Axies cannot be bred with their children and Axies cannot breed with their siblings.

When breeding, each gene has a chance to be passed down to offspring: Dominant (D): 37.5% chance to pass this gene to offspring. Recessive (R1): 9.375% chance to pass this gene to offspring. Minor Recessive (R2): 3.125% chance to pass this gene to offspring. You can use this calculator to look up the probabilities when breeding 2 Axies. While we don’t show recessive genes on our website yet, you can view them using this extension built by one of our community members, Freak.

The battle system was structured as an \"idle battle\" system with inspiration from games like \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" and \"Idle Heroes\". Classic, released in December 2019, grew the Axie community from a ragtag band of a few hundred missionaries to millions. The game is structured as a turn-based card battler where players create teams of Axies to duke it out in the arena. Axies draw cards based on the body parts they posses and you must play these cards at the optimal time and order to maximize your chance of victory. Classic was the first game ever to distribute in-game resources as ERC20 tokens. On April 6th, 2022, Axie Infinity: Origins was released in early access . Origins is an evolution of Axie's tactical card battler format. It introduces a real-time combat system, 3 free starter Axies, and vertical progression through Rune & Charm crafting. Origins features: Free starter Axies. Let your friends and family fall in love with Axie before needing to touch crypto and NFTs! Upgraded Axie art makes each Axie more visually distinct and special. Sequential turns for a faster, more dynamic experience. Energy / cards are reset each turn to encourage aggressive play-styles. Card changes. We’ve kept most cards in line with their original spirit. Eye & Ear Cards. This is the first time that eyes & ears have ever had cards! Runes / Charms as power-ups . Our first glimpse of Axie progression and upgrading is here!

Though it’s still in an early state, Ronin will continuously evolve over the years to serve the spirit and ethos of blockchain gaming. On the technical side, we are also looking into various solutions to further strengthen and scale Ronin. zKSyncs, for example, is looking promising, but it could take time until it’s production-ready — particularly for NFTs and games.” An extended AMA with Trung about Ronin can be found here ​",

As passionate gamers ourselves, we saw room in the world for a new kind of social contract between the participants within a gaming ecosystem. In this model, game players, designers, engineers, and creators work collectively under a set of aligned responsibilities and incentives. We think the world is long overdue for an approach that blurs the historic lines between builders and players: empowering all to create, grow, refine, champion, and benefit from the efforts of the collective. We also believe that these efforts need to be protected from co-optive middlemen (such as publishers, online game stores, etc) that limit access via their distribution channels. In short, we believe that equitable communities are the foundation of our gaming future, and we are aggressively moving towards demonstrating their potential with Axie Infinity. We believe that this is the path towards creating gaming that’s longer lasting, more rewarding, and above all, more fun!",

This is a pool of assets that has grown considerably (over 1B USD in value) due to Axie’s incredible community growth over the past year. We designed the Treasury to be under the direct influence of all holders of Axie Infinity Shards (AXS tokens). This means that in the future, we expect holders to govern how these resources are used. For example, they could be used to: supplement token staking rewards reduce the total long-term supply of AXS (ie, burning AXS). replenish resources for current initiatives, such as gaming issuance or the ecosystem fund once they are depleted. invest in new activities/initiatives that improve the overall community experience resource councils or working groups to carry out strategically important projects supplement token staking rewards reduce the total long-term supply of AXS (ie, burning AXS). replenish resources for current initiatives, such as gaming issuance or the ecosystem fund once they are depleted. invest in new activities/initiatives that improve the overall community experience resource councils or working groups to carry out strategically important projects We’re very excited to embark on this journey around the use of Treasury funds, but it’s increasingly clear that we need to do a much better job of helping both our community and the world around us understand our long term vision for Axie Infinity and the Treasury’s role in support of it. It’s hard to govern what might be non-intuitive to understand. Additionally, there are many outstanding operational and legal considerations that need to be approached carefully. In short, we believe that unlocking this pool of capital before the community ecosystem is prepared will likely result in inadvertent long term harm to our above stated vision for Axie Infinity. Therefore, when considering the overall governance of Axie Infinity and the Community Treasury, we think it’s important to practice progressive decentralization . What does this mean and what does the path towards unlocking the value in the Treasury look like? ​",

                "sub_info": "We define progressive decentralization as the deliberate, stepwise process we will undergo to enable active partnership/ownership with an increasingly broad set of community members. In short, we ultimately commit to fully empower any willing participant to contribute and benefit from their efforts within the Axie ecosystem. Hopefully, as you’re beginning to notice, we’re already experimenting with this in small ways. We need to unlock everyone’s collective potential, as meaningful contributions are only possible when those participants have the knowledge, experience, and supportive infrastructure needed to convert good intention into something valuable. Early within a decentralization process, a few founding members have the primary responsibility for guiding the collective, building the product to collaborate around while also creating a process to enable a broader group to partner and watching for indications of community buy-in / progress. Late within a decentralization process, the collective has the primary responsibility to guide one another as everyone works to advance the community’s well defined mission by self organizing within a milieu of easy to understand expectations, conventions, and social norms. While we are passionately committed to this end state, many of the prerequisites needed to properly equip interested contributors don’t yet exist. Why is this important? We want everyone to understand both our goal of full decentralization, and the process we’re undertaking to make this happen. Jesse Waldron of the Variant Fund laid out a helpful framework to summarize the cascading stages of progressive decentralization . A quick review shows that we’re still in the early stages, working to establish Axie’s core “product-market fit,” which refers to a product that consistently grows and addresses needs at scale. One measure of product-market fit is weekly growth of at least 5%. While we have experienced periods of hyper-growth, we have not seen long-term sustainable growth rates of 5% weekly growth to date. Axie Infinity: Classic, released in late 2019, never left Alpha and we recognized the need to build a major overhaul of the battle system: Axie Infinity: Origin. Land gameplay of course, has not been released yet. In the words of Jesse Walden: “During <this early> phase, the only thing that matters is product-market fit. To move fast toward finding it, it’s important to avoid design by committee (or community!) A product needs opinionated leadership to test hypotheses and update assumptions quickly.” As hopefully it’s apparent, we’ve established a core team to lead product development and oversee most decisions related to the progress of the game. This allows us to build and iterate quickly towards product-market fit. Hopefully you’ve also noticed that as time has passed, we’ve also started to seek direct input from the community around decisions such as gameplay and economic balancing. These attempts at engaging the community in decision-making are deliberately intended to get the community familiar with this growing engagement expectation, to learn how to best get input from large audiences, and to identify community members with exceptional interest in governance. This drum beat will only grow louder in the days to come. Even if Axie’s core product-market fit was clearly established, we still have a large number of technical and social governance coordination challenges that have never been solved before. For example, while we understand that our community is excited to experience on-chain governance, there is still much research around this topic that needs to be conducted. Vitalik Buterin recently wrote about the challenges faced by the current community governance models in Web 3 . To quote Vitalik directly: “Small groups of wealthy participants (\"whales\") are better at successfully executing decisions than large groups of small-holders . This is because of the tragedy of the commons among small-holders: each small-holder has only an insignificant influence on the outcome, and so they have little incentive to vote. Even if there are rewards for voting, there is little incentive to research and think carefully about what they are voting for. Coin voting governance empowers coin holders and coin holder interests at the expense of other parts of the community : protocol communities are made up of diverse constituencies that have many different values, visions and goals. Coin voting, however, only gives power to one constituency (coin holders, and especially wealthy ones), and leads to over-valuing the goal of making the coin price go up even if that involves harmful rent extraction. Conflict of interest issues : giving voting power to one constituency (coin holders), and especially over-empowering wealthy actors in that constituency, risks over-exposure to the conflicts-of-interest within that particular elite (eg. investment funds or holders that also hold tokens of other DeFi platforms that interact with the platform in question).” “Small groups of wealthy participants (\"whales\") are better at successfully executing decisions than large groups of small-holders .

Even for the largest projects on the platform, voter participation is typically limited to hundreds. When we do enable governance, we want it to be substantive and meaningful. We have not seen this from the current models and believe it will take some time to iterate and experiment towards a model that is airtight and has limits the potential for abuse. Fortunately, we’re learning a lot from community dialog, and we’re arriving at a collection of techniques that’ll help us address some of the concerns. For example, you might have seen us talk collectively about: Implementing an “Axie score” as a modifier to weight voting . This means allowing one’s contributions to the ecosystem in addition to their AXS ownership amount to be taken into account. We are currently considering a non-transferable badge system that could allow us to build a robust system around this in collaboration with the community. The creation of player-driven councils that ensure a variety of opinions and recommendations from specialists are used to inform the creation and structure of key proposals. Quadratic voting : quadratic voting is a system where voters have limited voting power and must spend this power wisely. For example, staking AXS could cause non-transferable voting power to accrue to the staker over time and that voting power would be burned when used to effect the outcome on a proposal. This creates a market dynamic around voting. Implementing an “Axie score” as a modifier to weight voting .

Perhaps as a framework to measure our progress, we’d like to share a set of phases and criteria for advancing towards full decentralization.

At least 3 outside teams are building games with over 100,000 DAU on top of Axie Infinity outside of the core Sky Mavis team. If these requirements are not met by the end of 2023, Sky Mavis will lead the formation of a steering committee or similar vehicle to discuss a path forward. Alternatives include hosting a virtual/physical governance summit and enlisting a 3rd party think-tank. We are also open to exploring any combination of these alternatives that gets us through this phase as quickly as possible. Phase 2: Growth Stage Certain key product decisions are made through a formal on-chain governance process. The parameters and rules of this voting process are iterated on and improved with experience. AXS tokens are emitted through AXS staking according to the staking schedule. AXS token emissions through gameplay scale as product market fit allows for higher reward issuance without pressure on the economy. This increases AXS ownership among the playerbase and decentralizes ownership of the network. Sky Mavis manages the ecosystem fund with input and soft voting from the community. The fund is used for investments and grants that build vital goods, products, and educational tools for the Axie ecosystem. Sky Mavis brings forward proposals around use of the Community Treasury.

AXS token emissions through gameplay scale as product market fit allows for higher reward issuance without pressure on the economy. Eventually, the gaming issuance will run out of tokens and need to be replenished through a combination of distributions from the Treasury and sponsors. The ecosystem fund is likely fully deployed at this stage. During this stage the gaming issuance allocation becomes fully distributed to the community.

Axie features a player-owned economy where players have complete ownership of their digital assets and can buy, sell, and trade them just like physical trading cards and collectibles. The Axie universe is always expanding through new games and experiences. Many of these experiences will allow players to compete with each other using complex strategies and tactics to attain top rankings or be rewarded with coveted resources. Others will have them complete quests, defeat bosses, and unlock in-depth storylines. The number of Axie combination is almost infinite. Each Axie has a variety of parts based on a unique genetic code. These genes correspond to body parts which can be interpreted in different ways by different experiences. For example, the first generation of Axie games have all featured systems where Axies can play cards or use moves in battle determined by their body parts.",

While still in early access, Axie is ranked the #1 Ethereum game by daily, weekly, and monthly active users. Players have spent over 1M ETH (4B+ USD) so far in the Axie universe. While Axie is a fun game, it's also taken on characteristics of a social network and earning platform due to the strong community and opportunity to truly own resources earned within the games. A key difference between Axie and a traditional game is that Blockchain economic design unlocks the ability to have complex player-owned economies and reward players who are able to reach advanced levels of skill. Players are able to have fun and work towards ambitious goals while simultaneously earning potential resources that will have real monetary value due to an open economic system and demand from other players - “Play-and-Earn”. Currently, players can gain more resources to advance in the game by: Competing in Battles to win leaderboard prizes as well as Smooth Love Potions (SLP) Breeding Axies to produce new ones with particular Body Part combinations Collecting and speculating on rare Axies such as Mystics and Origins Creating art and content On-boarding newcomers to the Axie universe Competing in Battles to win leaderboard prizes as well as Smooth Love Potions (SLP) Breeding Axies to produce new ones with particular Body Part combinations Collecting and speculating on rare Axies such as Mystics and Origins Creating art and content On-boarding newcomers to the Axie universe",

When we started this journey 4 years we weren't sure where we'd end up but we believed that if we asked the right questions we could build something with you that had never been seen before. We asked: What if we built a game that could onboard the world to Web3? What if we could make crypto nostalgic,educational, and immersive? What if a game could be built by developers and players working together through aligned incentives? What if we built a game that could onboard the world to Web3?

        "info": "Lunacia, the Axie homeland, is divided into tokenized plots of land which act as homes and bases of operation for their Axies. Plots can be upgraded over time using a variety of resources and crafting ingredients that can be found when playing the game. In addition, land-owners might find AXS tokens on their land plots, or use the Axies that occupy the land plot to explore resource nodes on the map. When interacting with resources nodes Axies can find AXS and potentially other resources. Resource Gathering and Crafting Resources will spawn in nodes across Lunacia and be used to upgrade both land and Axies. Landholders will have first rights to any resources that spawn on their land. Resources will spawn in nodes across Lunacia and be used to upgrade both land and Axies. Landholders will have first rights to any resources that spawn on their land. Real-Time PvE Battles Monsters called Chimera are terrorizing Lunacia. Players will be able to take on Chimera in real-time battles either alone or in groups. Chimera will drop an assortment of resources, items, and blueprints used to upgrade land and individual Axies. Additional details about land will be released in time. A plot owned and designed by cloudwhite The World Lunacia consists of 90,601 plots of Land. These Land plots are represented as Non-Fungible Tokens and can be freely traded by players. Land gameplay is still being actively developed and will be released in phases. Phase 1 of this experience will focus more upon simulation and land management (production, resource gathering, building, and trading). Phase 2 will build in additional management gameplay elements (such as skill trees, jobs, and social/cooperative activities). Phase 3 will focus more on group strategic gameplay (defend, battle, conquer). Throughout the continuous evolution of Lunacia, features will be added, and Axies will have an ever-expanding set of experiences they will encounter. However, between each event and game release phase, major events that affect all of Lunacia will occur, giving players a sense of progression at a world scale.

The goal of the play and earn allocation is to attract a wide range of players to the Axie ecosystem in the hunt for token rewards and to give ownership and stake to the most active community members. We envision using the play and earn portion of the issuance to reward key behaviors within our ecosystem such as: Competing in the arena and winning matches. Winning tournaments. Interacting with and tending to your land plots. Using the Axie Infinity marketplace. Breeding Axies. Using future Axie products that haven't been announced yet. Competing in the arena and winning matches. Winning tournaments. Interacting with and tending to your land plots. Using the Axie Infinity marketplace. Breeding Axies. Using future Axie products that haven't been announced yet. ‌The Play and Earn allocation can be seen as a marketing budget for the Axie ecosystem. When certain game modes and products are ready to be promoted, its play to earn allocation could be increased. These allocations are something that could potentially be decided by governance over time. The Axie Infinity Shards earned through the Play and Earn allocation will initially be open for trading immediately, but the Sky Mavis team will monitor the situation closely to decide if a lock-up on rewards is needed. Why Play and Earn? A game needs players. By simply playing the game, community members are adding value to the network and should be rewarded. It ’s simple, but revolutionary. We’re looking for missionaries to align incentives with as we change the gaming world forever. Axie is a living, breathing organism; it’s still a toddler. Our revolution is young but spreading quickly -- AXS has been designed as a growth hormone to take the toddler to maturity. ​ ​ ​",

As newly formed beings, the Axies in Raylights have to discover the farming and growing techniques needed to build Lunacia into a true homeland. Raylight’s gameplay centers around sowing minerals beneath your land to grow and unlock various recipes and plants! As you progress and experiment with different combinations of mineral inputs, you’ll unlock new layers to sow minerals and new recipes and codes! Who will be the first to complete the Archive of Raylights? We envision Raylights as a peaceful, social experience that allows landholders to cultivate and pursue the perfect aesthetic for their plots. Plants are grown by sowing minerals through the seedling nursery. Simply drag and drop the mineral that you want to place on the ground layers to the ‘Add mineral’ box. After a combination of minerals has been added, drag an Axie into the “Add Axie” box and press the grow button! You’ll see a time–sit back and wait for your plant to appear! The plant will then go into the “Items” tab where you’ll be able to drag it onto your plot. Minerals are used to conduct research through the Seedling Nursery. Currently, there are 10 types of minerals in the game: Edenite Aqua Beastium Serpentine Amber Aerium Mechanium Solar Obsidian Citrine Edenite Aqua Beastium Serpentine Amber Aerium Mechanium Solar Obsidian Citrine When you first start in the game, you have access to 3 minerals – Edenite, Aqua and Beastium. To unlock more minerals you will need to clear in-game missions! Different Mineral Codes unlock different plants although some common plants have multiple recipes, you can think of these plants as weeds. The sequence of the minerals placed matters and different Land rarities have different codes! A key aspect of Raylights is the pursuit of a perfectly aesthetic plot.",

By staking your AXS you’ll be able to earn AXS rewards when you lock up your tokens through the staking dashboard. In the future, staking AXS will give you voting rights and a say over the use of the Community Treasury which now holds over a billion dollars in tokens . ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Incentivizing stakers to add value to Axie Infinity - The Axie Score. In the future, we may upgrade our staking system to give better rewards to those that have measurably added value to the Axie ecosystem prior to claiming. There is still much research and experimentation to be done in this aspect of governance. The stakers who are not players or interested in participating in governance could be able to delegate their required \"work\" to other parties. This might lead to a future where guilds or corporations with massive amounts of AXS will need to look for talented players who can ensure a high enough Axie score to collect weekly yield. ​ ",
