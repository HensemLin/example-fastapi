    "info": "Axie Infinity will be run using a Game-as-a-Service model where new features will be introduced over time. Axie can potentially earn revenue from selling Axies, Land, cosmetics, and in-game consumables. Additionally, there will be fees when players want to level up their game characters, play in tournaments, and craft new assets. All the fees and revenue generated by Axie Infinity will be placed in the Community Treasury which is governed by the AXS holders. For now, these are the primary fees in the Axie universe: A breeding fee, paid in AXS, for breeding Axies. A 4.25% Axie Marketplace fee taken from successful sales of Axie NFT assets: Axies, land, and land items. A breeding fee, paid in AXS, for breeding Axies.
