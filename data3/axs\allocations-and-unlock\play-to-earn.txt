    "info": "​ ​ ​ The play and earn issuance represents 20% of the total AXS supply. The goal of the play and earn allocation is to attract a wide range of players to the Axie ecosystem in the hunt for token rewards and to give ownership and stake to the most active community members. We envision using the play and earn portion of the issuance to reward key behaviors within our ecosystem such as: Competing in the arena and winning matches. Winning tournaments. Interacting with and tending to your land plots. Using the Axie Infinity marketplace. Breeding Axies. Using future Axie products that haven't been announced yet. Competing in the arena and winning matches. Winning tournaments. Interacting with and tending to your land plots. Using the Axie Infinity marketplace. Breeding Axies. Using future Axie products that haven't been announced yet. ‌The Play and Earn allocation can be seen as a marketing budget for the Axie ecosystem. When certain game modes and products are ready to be promoted, its play to earn allocation could be increased. These allocations are something that could potentially be decided by governance over time. The Axie Infinity Shards earned through the Play and Earn allocation will initially be open for trading immediately, but the Sky Mavis team will monitor the situation closely to decide if a lock-up on rewards is needed. Why Play and Earn? A game needs players. By simply playing the game, community members are adding value to the network and should be rewarded. It ’s simple, but revolutionary. We’re looking for missionaries to align incentives with as we change the gaming world forever. Axie is a living, breathing organism; it’s still a toddler. Our revolution is young but spreading quickly -- AXS has been designed as a growth hormone to take the toddler to maturity. ​ ​ ​",
