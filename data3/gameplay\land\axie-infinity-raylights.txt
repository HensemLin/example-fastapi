            "sub_info": "Axie Infinity: Raylights starts at the dawn of axie civilization on Lunacia. As newly formed beings, the Axies in Raylights have to discover the farming and growing techniques needed to build Lunacia into a true homeland. Raylight’s gameplay centers around sowing minerals beneath your land to grow and unlock various recipes and plants! As you progress and experiment with different combinations of mineral inputs, you’ll unlock new layers to sow minerals and new recipes and codes! Who will be the first to complete the Archive of Raylights? We envision Raylights as a peaceful, social experience that allows landholders to cultivate and pursue the perfect aesthetic for their plots. Plants are grown by sowing minerals through the seedling nursery. Simply drag and drop the mineral that you want to place on the ground layers to the ‘Add mineral’ box. After a combination of minerals has been added, drag an Axie into the “Add Axie” box and press the grow button! You’ll see a time–sit back and wait for your plant to appear! The plant will then go into the “Items” tab where you’ll be able to drag it onto your plot. Minerals are used to conduct research through the Seedling Nursery. Currently, there are 10 types of minerals in the game: Edenite Aqua Beastium Serpentine Amber Aerium Mechanium Solar Obsidian Citrine Edenite Aqua Beastium Serpentine Amber Aerium Mechanium Solar Obsidian Citrine When you first start in the game, you have access to 3 minerals – Edenite, Aqua and Beastium. To unlock more minerals you will need to clear in-game missions! Different Mineral Codes unlock different plants although some common plants have multiple recipes, you can think of these plants as weeds. The sequence of the minerals placed matters and different Land rarities have different codes! A key aspect of Raylights is the pursuit of a perfectly aesthetic plot.",
