{"prompt": "Topic: Axie Infinity\nTitle: Axie Infinity Shards - $AXS", "completion": "Axie Infinity Shards(AXS) are an ERC-20 governance token for the Axie Universe. AXS holders will be able to claim rewards if they stake their tokens, play the game, and participate in key governance votes. Players will also be able to earn $AXS when they play various games within the Axie Infinity Universe and through user-generated content initiatives. Our goal with Axie Infinity Shards is to align the incentives between the players of the game and the developers in novel and exciting ways. The mechanisms described above have two main goals: To reward players for interacting with Axie Infinity while simultaneously incentivizing them to hold on to their tokens so they can claim additional rewards. To decentralize the ownership and governance of Axie Infinity. To reward players for interacting with Axie Infinity while simultaneously incentivizing them to hold on to their tokens so they can claim additional rewards. To decentralize the ownership and governance of Axie Infinity. We want Axie to become the first game truly owned and operated by the community that plays it. This opens up limitless possibilities but must be approached carefully. In the past, projects have been abandoned and become stagnant using the term \u201cdecentralization\u201d as a ruse. The shift to a true Decentralized organization will occur gradually over time. In early 2021, the Community Treasury will go live. The Community Treasury will begin to receive revenues generated by Axie Infinity as well as a portion of staking rewards. This treasury will be governed by AXS stakers eventually, once the network has become sufficiently decentralized. The Treasury receives inflows from: 4.25% of all Axie NFT marketplace transactions. The AXS portion of the breeding fee. 4.25% of all Axie NFT marketplace transactions. The AXS portion of the breeding fee. More streams will be added in the future from cosmetic sales, tournament entree fees, licensing fees, and more as new opportunities present themselves. In the early days of Axie Infinity, staking issuance will be high-- encouraging a high portion of staked AXS without requiring an additional source of funding. However, as the issuance allocation drops over time, there will need to be another source of funding to encourage a high percentage of staked AXS. This is a potential use for the Community Treasury, which will have a sustainable source of funding from fees related to Axie infinity.

{"prompt": "Topic: Axie Infinity\nTitle: Decentralized Organization\nSub-Title: The Community Treasury", "completion": "While there are a number of interrelated components to a truly decentralized gaming ecosystem, the focus of this update is on describing the way forward for governing the Axie Community Treasury, one of our foundational pillars. This is a pool of assets that has grown considerably (over 1B USD in value) due to Axie\u2019s incredible community growth over the past year. We designed the Treasury to be under the direct influence of all holders of Axie Infinity Shards (AXS tokens). This means that in the future, we expect holders to govern how these resources are used. For example, they could be used to: supplement token staking rewards reduce the total long-term supply of AXS (ie, burning AXS). replenish resources for current initiatives, such as gaming issuance or the ecosystem fund once they are depleted. invest in new activities/initiatives that improve the overall community experience resource councils or working groups to carry out strategically important projects supplement token staking rewards reduce the total long-term supply of AXS (ie, burning AXS). replenish resources for current initiatives, such as gaming issuance or the ecosystem fund once they are depleted. invest in new activities/initiatives that improve the overall community experience resource councils or working groups to carry out strategically important projects We\u2019re very excited to embark on this journey around the use of Treasury funds, but it\u2019s increasingly clear that we need to do a much better job of helping both our community and the world around us understand our long term vision for Axie Infinity and the Treasury\u2019s role in support of it. It\u2019s hard to govern what might be non-intuitive to understand. Additionally, there are many outstanding operational and legal considerations that need to be approached carefully. In short, we believe that unlocking this pool of capital before the community ecosystem is prepared will likely result in inadvertent long term harm to our above stated vision for Axie Infinity. Therefore, when considering the overall governance of Axie Infinity and the Community Treasury, we think it\u2019s important to practice progressive decentralization . What does this mean and what does the path towards unlocking the value in the Treasury look like? \nHere are some links related to the topic: https://explorer.roninchain.com/address/ronin:a99cacd1427f493a95b585a5c7989a08c86a616b"}
{"prompt": "Topic: Axie Infinity\nTitle: Decentralized Organization\nSub-Title: The Progressive Decentralization Continuum", "completion": "We define progressive decentralization as the deliberate, stepwise process we will undergo to enable active partnership/ownership with an increasingly broad set of community members. In short, we ultimately commit to fully empower any willing participant to contribute and benefit from their efforts within the Axie ecosystem. Hopefully, as you\u2019re beginning to notice, we\u2019re already experimenting with this in small ways. We need to unlock everyone\u2019s collective potential, as meaningful contributions are only possible when those participants have the knowledge, experience, and supportive infrastructure needed to convert good intention into something valuable. Early within a decentralization process, a few founding members have the primary responsibility for guiding the collective, building the product to collaborate around while also creating a process to enable a broader group to partner and watching for indications of community buy-in / progress. Late within a decentralization process, the collective has the primary responsibility to guide one another as everyone works to advance the community\u2019s well defined mission by self organizing within a milieu of easy to understand expectations, conventions, and social norms. While we are passionately committed to this end state, many of the prerequisites needed to properly equip interested contributors don\u2019t yet exist. Why is this important? We want everyone to understand both our goal of full decentralization, and the process we\u2019re undertaking to make this happen. Jesse Waldron of the Variant Fund laid out a helpful framework to summarize the cascading stages of progressive decentralization . A quick review shows that we\u2019re still in the early stages, working to establish Axie\u2019s core \u201cproduct-market fit,\u201d which refers to a product that consistently grows and addresses needs at scale. One measure of product-market fit is weekly growth of at least 5%. While we have experienced periods of hyper-growth, we have not seen long-term sustainable growth rates of 5% weekly growth to date. Axie Infinity: Classic, released in late 2019, never left Alpha and we recognized the need to build a major overhaul of the battle system: Axie Infinity: Origin. Land gameplay of course, has not been released yet. In the words of Jesse Walden: \u201cDuring <this early> phase, the only thing that matters is product-market fit. To move fast toward finding it, it\u2019s important to avoid design by committee (or community!) A product needs opinionated leadership to test hypotheses and update assumptions quickly.\u201d As hopefully it\u2019s apparent, we\u2019ve established a core team to lead product development and oversee most decisions related to the progress of the game. This allows us to build and iterate quickly towards product-market fit. Hopefully you\u2019ve also noticed that as time has passed, we\u2019ve also started to seek direct input from the community around decisions such as gameplay and economic balancing. These attempts at engaging the community in decision-making are deliberately intended to get the community familiar with this growing engagement expectation, to learn how to best get input from large audiences, and to identify community members with exceptional interest in governance. This drum beat will only grow louder in the days to come. Even if Axie\u2019s core product-market fit was clearly established, we still have a large number of technical and social governance coordination challenges that have never been solved before. For example, while we understand that our community is excited to experience on-chain governance, there is still much research around this topic that needs to be conducted. Vitalik Buterin recently wrote about the challenges faced by the current community governance models in Web 3 . To quote Vitalik directly: \u201cSmall groups of wealthy participants (\"whales\") are better at successfully executing decisions than large groups of small-holders . This is because of the tragedy of the commons among small-holders: each small-holder has only an insignificant influence on the outcome, and so they have little incentive to vote. Even if there are rewards for voting, there is little incentive to research and think carefully about what they are voting for. Coin voting governance empowers coin holders and coin holder interests at the expense of other parts of the community : protocol communities are made up of diverse constituencies that have many different values, visions and goals. Coin voting, however, only gives power to one constituency (coin holders, and especially wealthy ones), and leads to over-valuing the goal of making the coin price go up even if that involves harmful rent extraction. Conflict of interest issues : giving voting power to one constituency (coin holders), and especially over-empowering wealthy actors in that constituency, risks over-exposure to the conflicts-of-interest within that particular elite (eg. investment funds or holders that also hold tokens of other DeFi platforms that interact with the platform in question).\u201d \u201cSmall groups of wealthy participants (\"whales\") are better at successfully executing decisions than large groups of small-holders .

Even for the largest projects on the platform, voter participation is typically limited to hundreds. When we do enable governance, we want it to be substantive and meaningful. We have not seen this from the current models and believe it will take some time to iterate and experiment towards a model that is airtight and has limits the potential for abuse. Fortunately, we\u2019re learning a lot from community dialog, and we\u2019re arriving at a collection of techniques that\u2019ll help us address some of the concerns. For example, you might have seen us talk collectively about: Implementing an \u201cAxie score\u201d as a modifier to weight voting . This means allowing one\u2019s contributions to the ecosystem in addition to their AXS ownership amount to be taken into account. We are currently considering a non-transferable badge system that could allow us to build a robust system around this in collaboration with the community. The creation of player-driven councils that ensure a variety of opinions and recommendations from specialists are used to inform the creation and structure of key proposals. Quadratic voting : quadratic voting is a system where voters have limited voting power and must spend this power wisely. For example, staking AXS could cause non-transferable voting power to accrue to the staker over time and that voting power would be burned when used to effect the outcome on a proposal. This creates a market dynamic around voting. Implementing an \u201cAxie score\u201d as a modifier to weight voting .

{"prompt": "Topic: Axie Infinity\nTitle: Decentralized Organization\nSub-Title: Updating Governance Timelines", "completion": "As it\u2019s likely clear from the above, we have a lot of work to do. In retrospect, placing concrete dates on how we\u2019d proceed with progressively decentralizing might have been misguided, given the evolving lessons we and the space around us are actively trying to learn. We want to move as fast as we can in this direction while protecting our vision, and we want your partnership in accelerating our pace. Perhaps as a framework to measure our progress, we\u2019d like to share a set of phases and criteria for advancing towards full decentralization. Our hope is that it allows us to ground our community discussion, and serves as a call to action: Phase 1: Product-Market Fit The Sky Mavis team manages product development and makes key product decisions with feedback and input from the community. AXS tokens are emitted through AXS staking according to the staking schedule. AXS tokens are strategically emitted through the gameplay reward allocation. Sky Mavis manages the ecosystem fund. It\u2019s used to fund early experiments around grant programs. Sky Mavis will begin the process of council formation around key topics such as gameplay balancing, economic balancing, and cultural development. The Community Treasury sits dormant. Governance experimentation with lightweight forums and minor proposals with an emphasis on product feedback (ie, trial voting, non-binding referendums, etc). Gauge interest in various voting systems Sky Mavis to research and explore options around commercial rights for Axies.

Gauge interest in various voting systems Sky Mavis to research and explore options around commercial rights for Axies. Criteria for Moving to Phase 2 An Axie game that has over 10 million DAU and average weekly growth rates of 5% for 6 consecutive months or 8 months out of 12 over a 12 month period. Construction of a functional, easy-to-understand governance portal and process that avoids the pitfalls outlined earlier in this article. At least 3 outside teams are building games with over 100,000 DAU on top of Axie Infinity outside of the core Sky Mavis team.

At least 3 outside teams are building games with over 100,000 DAU on top of Axie Infinity outside of the core Sky Mavis team. If these requirements are not met by the end of 2023, Sky Mavis will lead the formation of a steering committee or similar vehicle to discuss a path forward. Alternatives include hosting a virtual/physical governance summit and enlisting a 3rd party think-tank. We are also open to exploring any combination of these alternatives that gets us through this phase as quickly as possible. Phase 2: Growth Stage Certain key product decisions are made through a formal on-chain governance process. The parameters and rules of this voting process are iterated on and improved with experience. AXS tokens are emitted through AXS staking according to the staking schedule. AXS token emissions through gameplay scale as product market fit allows for higher reward issuance without pressure on the economy. This increases AXS ownership among the playerbase and decentralizes ownership of the network. Sky Mavis manages the ecosystem fund with input and soft voting from the community. The fund is used for investments and grants that build vital goods, products, and educational tools for the Axie ecosystem. Sky Mavis brings forward proposals around use of the Community Treasury.

Phase 3: Community Governance & Ownership The on-chain governance process around product adjustments and Community Treasury management begins to settle and become dynamic only through a formal amendment process. AXS token emissions through gameplay scale as product market fit allows for higher reward issuance without pressure on the economy. Eventually, the gaming issuance will run out of tokens and need to be replenished through a combination of distributions from the Treasury and sponsors. The ecosystem fund is likely fully deployed at this stage. During this stage the gaming issuance allocation becomes fully distributed to the community. Proposals related to the Community Treasury are opened up to the Community. Possible drafting of an Axie constitution.

Axie features a player-owned economy where players have complete ownership of their digital assets and can buy, sell, and trade them just like physical trading cards and collectibles. The Axie universe is always expanding through new games and experiences. Many of these experiences will allow players to compete with each other using complex strategies and tactics to attain top rankings or be rewarded with coveted resources. Others will have them complete quests, defeat bosses, and unlock in-depth storylines. The number of Axie combination is almost infinite. Each Axie has a variety of parts based on a unique genetic code. These genes correspond to body parts which can be interpreted in different ways by different experiences. For example, the first generation of Axie games have all featured systems where Axies can play cards or use moves in battle determined by their body parts."}

While still in early access, Axie is ranked the #1 Ethereum game by daily, weekly, and monthly active users. Players have spent over 1M ETH (4B+ USD) so far in the Axie universe. While Axie is a fun game, it's also taken on characteristics of a social network and earning platform due to the strong community and opportunity to truly own resources earned within the games. A key difference between Axie and a traditional game is that Blockchain economic design unlocks the ability to have complex player-owned economies and reward players who are able to reach advanced levels of skill. Players are able to have fun and work towards ambitious goals while simultaneously earning potential resources that will have real monetary value due to an open economic system and demand from other players - \u201cPlay-and-Earn\u201d.

{"prompt": "Topic: Axie Infinity\nTitle: Play and Earn", "completion": " The play and earn issuance represents 20% of the total AXS supply. The goal of the play and earn allocation is to attract a wide range of players to the Axie ecosystem in the hunt for token rewards and to give ownership and stake to the most active community members. We envision using the play and earn portion of the issuance to reward key behaviors within our ecosystem such as: Competing in the arena and winning matches. Winning tournaments. Interacting with and tending to your land plots. Using the Axie Infinity marketplace. Breeding Axies. Using future Axie products that haven't been announced yet. Competing in the arena and winning matches. Winning tournaments. Interacting with and tending to your land plots. Using the Axie Infinity marketplace. Breeding Axies. Using future Axie products that haven't been announced yet. \u200cThe Play and Earn allocation can be seen as a marketing budget for the Axie ecosystem. When certain game modes and products are ready to be promoted, its play to earn allocation could be increased. These allocations are something that could potentially be decided by governance over time. The Axie Infinity Shards earned through the Play and Earn allocation will initially be open for trading immediately, but the Sky Mavis team will monitor the situation closely to decide if a lock-up on rewards is needed. Why Play and Earn? A game needs players. By simply playing the game, community members are adding value to the network and should be rewarded. It \u2019s simple, but revolutionary. We\u2019re looking for missionaries to align incentives with as we change the gaming world forever. Axie is a living, breathing organism; it\u2019s still a toddler. Our revolution is young but spreading quickly -- AXS has been designed as a growth hormone to take the toddler to maturity. "}

As newly formed beings, the Axies in Raylights have to discover the farming and growing techniques needed to build Lunacia into a true homeland. Raylight\u2019s gameplay centers around sowing minerals beneath your land to grow and unlock various recipes and plants! As you progress and experiment with different combinations of mineral inputs, you\u2019ll unlock new layers to sow minerals and new recipes and codes! Who will be the first to complete the Archive of Raylights? We envision Raylights as a peaceful, social experience that allows landholders to cultivate and pursue the perfect aesthetic for their plots. Plants are grown by sowing minerals through the seedling nursery. Simply drag and drop the mineral that you want to place on the ground layers to the \u2018Add mineral\u2019 box. After a combination of minerals has been added, drag an Axie into the \u201cAdd Axie\u201d box and press the grow button! You\u2019ll see a time\u2013sit back and wait for your plant to appear! The plant will then go into the \u201cItems\u201d tab where you\u2019ll be able to drag it onto your plot. Minerals are used to conduct research through the Seedling Nursery. Currently, there are 10 types of minerals in the game: Edenite Aqua Beastium Serpentine Amber Aerium Mechanium Solar Obsidian Citrine Edenite Aqua Beastium Serpentine Amber Aerium Mechanium Solar Obsidian Citrine When you first start in the game, you have access to 3 minerals \u2013 Edenite, Aqua and Beastium.

Axie has a 100% player-owned, real money economy. Rather than selling game items or copies, the developers of the game focus on growing the player to player economy. Marketplace fees go into a Community Treasury whose usage will be guided by AXS holders. The developers monetize through their ownership of AXS tokens. Axies are created by players using in-game resources (SLP & AXS) and sold to new/other players. You can think of Axie as a nation with a real economy. The holders of the AXS token are the government that receives tax revenues. The inventors/builders of the game, Sky Mavis, hold ~20% of all AXS tokens. Game resources and items are tokenized, meaning they can be sold to anyone, anywhere on open peer-to-peer markets.

{"prompt": "Topic: Axie Infinity\nTitle: Technology\nSub-Title: Decentralization and Blockchain", "completion": "We initially chose Ethereum back in 2018 due to the number of developers building on the platform, and the ability to recruit initial community members. As time passed it became clear that building a blockchain game solely on Ethereum would not be feasible from a scalability standpoint. We have learned that while our users care about blockchain technology they are focused on the benefits it can bring, rather than decentralizing too many features. As long as we provide a tamper-evident distributed ledger that ensures scarcity and allows our players to own and trade their assets it will be enough, for now. The mechanics of Play to Earn do not require a fully decentralized public blockchain. We believe that part of the ethos of web 3 is the idea of users being rewarded for the value that they bring to applications and this is what we choose to focus on with Axie."}
